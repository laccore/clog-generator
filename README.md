# Contact Log (CLOG) Generator

The [CSD](https://cse.umn.edu/csd) has to keep a list of all scientific contacts to report to NSF. This includes the somewhat onerous task of tracking all email contacts in a calendar year. This tool is designed to help ease that process.

It takes a .mbox file, extracts relevant information (To Address, From Address, Subject, Date), filters out known irrelevant email addresses or domains (live updating from Quickbase), and exports a .csv for importing into Quickbase for futher processesing.
